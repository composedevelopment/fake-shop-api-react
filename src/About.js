        This project is a demonstration of API interfacing using React, 
        as well as demonstrating features such as modals and managing a global state
        store with Redux. I thank you for taking the time to explore it, it was a very 
        fun exercise in web development. I'm proud to add it to my portfolio 
        and hope that potential employers enjoy it! ðŸ˜ƒ
